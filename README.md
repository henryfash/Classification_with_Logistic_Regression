# Classification with Logistic Regression

### 1. Logistic Regression
Problem Statement
- Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.
- You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

#### Task:
- Build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from their two exams


### 2. Regularized Logistic Regression
Problem Statement
- Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. 
- To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

#### Task: 
* Implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). The model should help determine whether microchips should be accepted or rejected.
