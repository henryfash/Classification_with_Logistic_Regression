# Classification with Logistic Regression

### 1. Logistic Regression
Problem Statement
- Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.
- You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

#### Task:
- Build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from their two exams


### 2. Regularized Logistic Regression
Problem Statement
- Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. 
- To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

#### Task: 
* Implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. The model should be able to help determine whether microchips should be accepted or rejected.
